This prepo is about a small React application that list the details of an account with some action that the user can do.

To create this I've used:

- React 0.15
- Redux
- Redux thunk
- Jest for testing

To run after checkout:

- yarn install
- yarn run

To run the tests:

- yarn run test

Next step:

- Add an external source for the data and retireve the data in an async way (I'd use axios as Promise library)
- Use sass for the CSS, addin a sass-loader in webpack config file
- Add functional test using Redux action list
- Add BDD test using Selenium
